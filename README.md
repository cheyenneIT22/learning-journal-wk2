## Learning Activities & Resources

This week I began Assignment 1 using the Joomla CMS and created a live website hosted through CloudAccess. As I had never used Joomla before, I spent time experimenting with the interface to understand how it works as an open-source content management system.

I explored different templates within Joomla to understand how template styles, layout positions, and module placements affect the appearance of a website. By switching between templates and adjusting their properties, I was able to see how Joomla separates content (articles) from presentation (templates), which was initially confusing but became clearer through experimentation.

My goal was to improve and evolve my previous project, *The Quiet Atlas*, which I built in the last practical using HTML and Bootstrap. Using Joomla allowed me to move from a static website to a CMS-based startup concept. I focused on shaping it into a more defined startup idea that encourages users to explore forgotten or unseen places around the world, highlighting the mystery and curiosity of discovering locations they may never have heard of before.

Using CloudAccess was very efficient, as it provided a 1-click Joomla installation and allowed me to work directly on a live hosted site without needing a local setup. This made the process smoother and allowed me to focus on learning Joomla rather than configuring hosting environments.

## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 2–4 hours per day working on this task.  
This time included:
- Researching what Joomla is and how it functions
- Watching tutorial videos
- Experimenting with templates and layout settings
- Creating articles and linking them through menus
- Customising the site to reflect my startup concept

## Content Insights

One of the most important things I learned is how Joomla structures websites differently compared to static HTML. Pages are created through articles and then connected to menu items, which initially required adjustment in my thinking. However, once I understood this workflow, it made content organisation more logical and scalable.

Experimenting with different templates helped me understand how powerful CMS systems are in separating design from content. I also gained insight into how startup websites can use structured layouts and navigation to guide users toward understanding the purpose of the site.

Transforming *The Quiet Atlas* into a startup-style website encouraged me to think more strategically about user experience. Instead of simply displaying stories, I focused on encouraging visitors to explore unknown places and feel intrigued by the idea that there are countless locations in the world they have never seen.

## Learning Insights/Career Insights

Learning Joomla has broadened my understanding of content management systems and how businesses use them to manage websites efficiently. As many organisations rely on CMS platforms, this skill is valuable for future employment in digital design, web development, or content management roles.

This week also reinforced the importance of experimentation when learning a new technology. Since I had never used Joomla before, I needed to actively research, test features, and explore settings to understand how everything connected. Watching tutorials alongside hands-on practice proved to be an effective learning strategy.

Using a hosted environment like CloudAccess demonstrated how websites can be deployed quickly and professionally, which is an important skill in real-world startup and business contexts. Overall, this task helped me transition from building a static website to understanding how scalable CMS-based websites operate.
